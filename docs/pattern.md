# Kubernetes Patterns
## What is a Kubernetes Pattern?

**Kubernetes design patterns** are **reusable solutions** to common problems encountered when designing, implementing, and managing resources within a Kubernetes environment.

The primary goal of these patterns is to help developers and architects build systems that are more *reliable*, *scalable*, *secure*, *maintainable*.

> Kubernetes Patterns are best practices, policies, and known techniques used to improve cluster quality and address recurring problems.

## KubePattern & Kubernetes Patterns

**KubePattern** helps you identify "smells" (anti-patterns or design flaws) in your cluster, which are defined in the **pattern-as-code** file. It then suggests you *apply* the correct **pattern** to resolve them.

:::info
How KubePattern works
1. **Scan**: KubePattern analyzes your cluster configuration
2. **Detect**: Identifies anti-patterns and design flaws ("smells")
3. **Suggest**: Recommends appropriate patterns based on best practices
4. **Apply**: Helps you implement the correct pattern-as-code solution
:::

## Use Cases

KubePattern addresses critical challenges in Kubernetes operations:

### Resource Management & Scheduling
- **Predictable Demands**: Ensure optimal resource allocation with proper requests/limits
- **Limit Range**: Enforce resource constraints at namespace level to prevent resource exhaustion

### Self-Healing & Resilience
- **Health Probe**: Implement liveness, readiness, and startup probes for automatic recovery
- **OOM Healer**: Detect and remediate Out-Of-Memory issues before they cascade

### Application Lifecycle
- **Sidecar**: Extend pod capabilities with auxiliary containers for logging, proxying, or monitoring
- **Init Container**: Prepare application environment before main containers start

### Cluster Hygiene & Governance
- **Krateo Referenced Resources**: Manage resource dependencies and prevent orphaned objects
- **Configuration Template**: Standardize ConfigMaps and Secrets across teams

:::warning
Those are just *examples* of use cases for Kubernetes Patterns, many more are listed in the [pattern registry](https://github.com/GabrieleGroppo/kubepattern-registry) or await you to **discover them**!

## Quick Example

**Before** (Anti-pattern detected):
```yaml
# Pod without resource requests/limits
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: my-app:latest
```

**After** (Predictable Demands pattern applied):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: my-app:latest
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```
